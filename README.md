# Prueba-html
<p> By performing this test, I realized that separating pages by view is one of the most organized ways you can do it.</p>
<p>Although you should always follow the instructions according to what the client requests.</p>

<h2>Index.html</h2>
<p>First, let's look at the index.html code. This is the link to the main page or home page.
In the index, we can find our header along with the other redirects to the other views.
We identify classes and a section with a short text.</p>
<h2>Projects.html</h2>
<p>Through the code called "projects.html" we can see screenshots of previous codes or projects already created. </p>
<h2>Presentation.html</h2>
<p>We can see a short personal presentation accompanied by an image</p>
<h2>Portfolio.html</h2>
<p>In the code called "portfolio.html" we can see some links and short descriptions about the project. The link to each of its repositories is shown.</p>
<h2>Contact.html</h2>
<p>Through the code called "contact.html," we can see a form with three fields to fill out, containing information such as the name, email address, and a message to be added by the person you wish to contact.</p>
<h2>To finish</h2>
<p>We can also see the compressed test file for better viewing of the images.

Thank you all for your attention. I hope my page is useful.</p>
